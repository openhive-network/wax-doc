# Intro to Wax library

Wax is a mulit-language object-oriented library for using the Hive blockchain API. There are currently three language implementations of the library: TypeScript, C++, and Python.  Each implementation of Wax incorporates the same code used by core Hive protocol library to define Hive objects (operations, transactions, etc), ensuring that Wax will always maintain compatibility with the core blockchain code.  

Wax enables developers to 1) create, manage, and interact with various objects of the Hive protocol such as operations and transactions and 2) make Hive API calls and process the responses to those calls (double check if this creates objects or not?).

Additionally, the Wax module simplifies the execution of JSON-API calls and provides built-in data formatters that automatically convert Hive operations into human-readable text (WHAT DOES THIS REALLY MEAN?).
