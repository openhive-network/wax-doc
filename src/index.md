# Welcome hive people

The Wax library is a TypeScript library that provides a set of tools and interfaces for interacting with the Hive blockchain ecosystem. It allows developers to create, manage, and interact with various components of the Hive blockchain, such as creating transactions, managing accounts, and performing blockchain operations.

The library offers a high-level API interface that abstracts away the complexities of interacting with the Hive blockchain, making it easier for developers to build applications and services on top of the Hive ecosystem.
