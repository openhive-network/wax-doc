# Signers

Wax allows users to securely sign transactions and messages using their private keys. This process ensures that only the rightful owner of the keys can authorize actions on their behalf, providing a robust layer of security for user accounts and assets.

## Supported Signers

1. **Software Signers**: These are applications or libraries that manage private keys and facilitate signing transactions, encrypting operations & memos on behalf of the user. Examples include:
